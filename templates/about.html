                      How do you differentiate between marketing and sales leads?
                    </div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p class="light">
                            This depends on your business model, however we suggest the basic distinction is that marketing leads are initial enquiries, that need more 
                            information, or communication before they convert into a sales lead.
                        </p>
                        <p class="light">
                            A sales lead is a more positive enquiry that has higher possibility of converting into business.
                        </p>   
                        <p class="light">
                            A transaction is where the sales lead has turned into a sale and money has exchanged hands.
                        </p>    
                        <p class="light">
                            Take into account that the flow of leads from marketing, through sales into a transation is not linear and will depend very much on the business, 
                            industry and whether you are B2B or B2C for example.
