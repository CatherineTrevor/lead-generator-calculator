# Project Overview

A site to assist people involved in strategic marketing decisions to manage data on leads generated by their marketing campaigns/activities. The number of leads generated and converted, and the related cost per lead provides important insight into the value provided by individual marketing campaigns, which in turn allows for strategies and budgets to be based on real data.

Site users also have access to the average cost per lead information from other companies using the site, providing a benchmark.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

Developed for those involved in strategic marketing decisions at mainly Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the site allows for better-informed decisions about marketing campaigns, based on the cost per marketing lead, and cost per converted sales lead per marketing activity/campaign.

Companies open an account and create campaign profiles, which include the cost of the campaign, number of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL), number of Sales Qualified Leads (SQL), and the number of leads that have converted into business. They are then presented with the cost per MQL and SQL, as well as a conversion hit rate from marketing to sales lead. This helps them to understand which activities provide the most converted leads, at the best cost. This information helps create the foundation for better-informed decisions for marketing strategies and budget planning.

Site users have access to anonymous comparable data, so they have a benchmark. This information is taken from the accounts using the site.

The site is free-to-use and mobile responsive.

### Target audience

Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that are unlikely to have a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool (such as Salesforce or MS Dynamics), or are relying on spreadsheets to manage this information. The site will be a source of information that can be updated as a campaign continues to run and then presented to stakeholders as needed.

Campaigns can be created, read, edited, and deleted by the account owner, following the CRUD basic operations of persistent storage. 

### User stories

    a. As a first-time visitor I want to quickly understand the purpose of the site
    b. As a first-time visitor I want to easily register an account
    c. As a first-time visitor I want to feel confident that the data I enter is secure
    d. As a first-time visitor I want to understand any cost associated with registration
    e. As a first-time visitor I want to quickly create a new campaign 
    f. As a first-time visitor I want to easily obtain comparative benchmark data

**Returning visitors**

    a. As a returning visitor I want to quickly and easily log into my account profile
    b. As a returning visitor I want to see all open campaigns
    c. As a returning visitor I want to quickly create a new campaign
    d. As a returning visitor I want to read existing campaign data
    e. As a returning visitor I want to easily update existing campaign and/or the account profile information
    f. As a returning visitor I want to delete campaign information with confidence

**Site administrator**

    a. As a site administrator I want to quickly and easily log into the admin area
    b. As a site administrator I want to create a new industry, communications platform, or campaign type category
    c. As a site administrator I want to read information about existing categories
    d. As a site administrator I want to easily update existing category information

## Scope

### Features

| Feature  | Details  | Internal Links |
|---|---|---|
| Nav bar | Consistent on each file using Jinga templating | Home - About - Benchmark data - Log In - Sign Up - (Log out for when users are logged in and Manage Categories when admin are logged in)|
| Favicon | Consistent on each file using Jinga templating | Home |
| Footer | Consistent on each file using Jinga templating. Copyright info | N/A |
| Contact form | Pop-up form accessible at the bottom of every page. Floating action button. | N/A |
| About | General site info and FAQs | Log In / Sign Up links |
| Benchmark Data | Graphs to display data from companies using the site | Log In / Sign up links |
| Log In page | Email address and password required. Also used for Admin log in  | Sign up page link |
| Sign Up page | Email address and password only required  | Log in page link |
| Administration profile | Category management: create, read, edit and delete | Create a new category or edit existing category link |

**Future features**

1. Currency exchange: In the future, users will be able to enter information in currency other than Euros. For comparison purposes, the financial data will be converted into Euros using an API.
2. Country dropdown connected to currency: A dropdown selection connecting the selected country to the relevant currency, which is then connected to a currency converter.
3. More in-depth comparison data based on campaign type and communication platform, not just industry. For the basic purposes of the site, the industry is more relevant as a benchmark. Comparing another company based purely on the communication platform does not give a clear picture, there are many other factors to consider. 

**Site warnings**

Warnings within the account.html file have been included to encourage site users to enter the information required to ensure data displays correctly on the graphs within benchmark_data.html.

Example 1

<div>
    <img src="supporting_docs/site_warning_1.jpg" width=500>
</div>

When a user signs up for an account they are only requested to input an email address and password; entering this minimal information ensures initial registration is required simple and quick. The user is then encouraged to update their information, in particular, industry as this is required for benchmark data. This warning remains until the user has selected an industry. Other information does not need to be updated.

Example 2

<div>
    <img src="supporting_docs/site_warning_2.jpg" width=500>
</div>

Campaigns need campaign type and communication platform: the above warning is a link to the campaign that needs updating. This ensures that if a campaign type or communication platform is not available, the
user knows to update that campaign.

## Structure

### Site map

![sitemap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76033080/119633678-474f4c00-be12-11eb-8d83-54129e340f32.jpg)

## Skeleton

For wireframes see separate [SKELETON.md file](SKELETON.md).

**Database schema**

The database schema was created using [Creately](https://creately.com/). 

Industry field is dropdown to reduce the risk of misspellings - this data is required to populate graphs displayed on benchmark-data.html, so the input must be uniformed, rather than free-text. The Industry listing will be managed by Administration who will have access to create, edit and delete the industry options, in addition to campaign type and communication platform.

Country field in the account profile is a dropdown connected to [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all) and saved in Mongo DB.

Calculations are input into a separate collection, to allow for data to be further manipulated and displayed in the graph on benchmark-data.html.

Contacts are not connected to any other collection.

## Surface

### Template

The site uses the [Parallax template](https://materializecss.com/templates/parallax-template/preview.html) from Materialize (https://materializecss.com), which has been heavily modified.

### Typography

Font families used: Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif as set by the Materialize template.

### Color scheme

Based on the blue-grey color scheme, with a combination of blue-grey lighten and white text, as supplied by [Materlialize](https://materializecss.com/color.html).
