# Project Overview

A site designed to assist those making strategic marketing decisions with knowledge regarding the value provided by marketing campaigns.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

The site is designed for those involved in strategic marketing decisions to be better informed about the cost per marketing lead, and cost per converted sales lead per marketing activity / campaign that they conduct.

Companies open an account and create a campaign profile, which includes the cost of the campaign, number of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) and number of converted or Sales Qualified Leads (SQL). They are then presented with the cost per MQL and SQL, as well as a hit rate. This information gives the foundation for better informed decisions for marketing strategies and budget planning.

The user will also have access to comparible external data, and that from other companies using the site, so they have a benchmark.

### Target audience

Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that may not have a sophisticated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, or are relying on a spreadsheet to manage this information. The site will be a source of information that can be updated as a campaign continues to run, and then presented to stakeholders as needed.
